            Nowadays, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has been perfecting itself in a frightening way
            and in an increasingly shorter space of time between its significant advances.

            One of the problems involved in the subject is the security of the moral and physical
            integrity of the human being which must be concerned by the state.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Brazil it was introduced (PL 2.338/2023), in order to parameterize and gather
            guidelines that guarantee the jurisprudence and protection of users, as well as to
            configure metrics of obligations and responsibilities for consumers and operators of AI
            systems.

                The PL (Draft Law) seeks to follow the development of AI in the country in such a
                way that the risks against the protection of human rights are minimized, with the
                instrumentation applied safely it is possible to aim for an exponential and
                profitable growth for the socio-economic development of the country.
            </p>

            One of the potential risks of using AI is the establishment of the psychopolitical
            control that the state can exercise over society through automated AI actions,
            configured and defined by a collective behavioral pattern through Big Data analysis that
            is used for discipline, control and incentive of properly induced behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is public knowledge that data corresponding to drawing a collective profile so that
            the spread of an ideological discourse and/or propaganda of political significance
            should be delimited according to standards developed, discussed and approved in the
            senate for implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
            As well as the deliberately obtaining of data that holds strictly confidential
            information such as the extensive acquisition of compulsory population data (demographic
            census, biometric collection, access to public security cameras, etc.) by the
            government, such use with AI is directly harmful and poses serious risks to guaranteed
            democracy and fundamental rights.
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, it is of extreme importance that ethical and legal parameters are delimited
            for the State, and that the limits are duly respected within the judicial norms, so that
            AI is developed for better aid in the productivity and intellectual capacity of the
            human being minimizing greater risks to the moral and physical integrity of society.
